    text: Adding gravity and the "jump" action.

  - heading: Lesson 4 - Move (part 1)
    text: Added a Cinemachine Virtual Camera with an Orbital Transposer that follows the player's avatar and a Composer that looks at the avatar's head. Added absolute directional movement (it ignores the camera). 
    linkText:
    url:
  - heading: Lesson 5 - Move (part 2)
    text: Changed movement to be relative to the camera. Quaternion.LookRotation, vector extension methods, Mathf.Atan2, and Euler angles.
    linkText:
    url:
  - heading: Lesson 6 - Move (part 3)
    text: In-air movement that allows some lateral movement, while preserving momentum and enforces speed limits.
    linkText:

  - heading: Lesson 7 - Moving Platforms (part 1)
    text: Create an animated moving platform. Player script detects collisions with OnControllerColliderHit, and remembers when it hits a MovingPlatform. In the Player's FixedUpdate, add touchingPlatform velocity to Player. Ensure the platform uses the "animate physics" update mode.
    linkText:
    url:
  - heading: Lesson 8 - Moving Platforms (part 2)
    text: Removed camera jittering when riding a platform, and added momentum when jumping from a moving platform.

  - heading: Lesson 9 - Wall running & jumping (part 1)
    text: Updated OnControllerColliderHit to detect collision with walls. Used Vector3.ProjectOnPlane and Vector3.Normalize to determine direction of wall run. Override character's velocity when on the wall according to the computed direction.
